    "Self-RAG is a new framework to train an arbitrary LM to learn to retrieve, generate, and critique to enhance the factuality and quality of generations, without hurting the versatility of LLMs. It outperformed ChatGPT and retrieval-augmented LLama2 Chat on six tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a widely-adopted Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG; Figure left) approach, Self-RAG retrieves on demand (e.g., can retrieve multiple times or completely skip retrieval) given diverse queries, and criticize its own generation from multiple fine-grained aspects by predicting reflection tokens as an integral part of generation. It conducts a segment-wise beam search to select the output that maximizes the utility for diverse preferences. \n",
