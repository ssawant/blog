    "Vision Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4, Flamingo, BLIP-2 and LLaVA have demonstrated significant advancements in addressing open-ended visual question-answering (VQA) tasks. However, these models cannot accurately interpret images infused with text, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard procedures for extracting information from images often involve learning a fixed set of query embeddings. These embeddings are designed to encapsulate image contexts and are later used as soft prompt inputs in LLMs. Yet, this process is limited to the token count, potentially curtailing the recognition of scenes with text-rich context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve upon them, the present study introduces BLIVA: an augmented version of InstructBLIP with Visual Assistant. BLIVA incorporates the query embeddings from InstructBLIP and also directly projects encoded patch embeddings into the LLM, a technique inspired by LLaVA. This approach assists the model to capture intricate details potentially missed during the query decoding process.\n",
    "\n",
    "BLIVA uses a Q-Former to draw out instruction-aware visual features from the patch embeddings generated by a frozen image encoder. These learned query embeddings are then fed as soft prompt inputs into the frozen Language-Learning Model (LLM). Additionally, the system repurposes the originally encoded patch embeddings through a fully connected projection layer, serving as a supplementary source of visual information for the frozen LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "During experiment, BLIVA significantly enhances performance in processing text-rich VQA benchmarks (up to 17.76% in OCR-VQA benchmark) and in undertaking general (not particularly text-rich) VQA benchmarks (up to 7.9% in Visual Spatial Reasoning benchmark), and achieved 17.72% overall improvement in a comprehensive multimodal LLM benchmark (MME), comparing to baseline InstructBLIP. BLIVA demonstrates significant capability in decoding real-world images, irrespective of text presence.\n",
