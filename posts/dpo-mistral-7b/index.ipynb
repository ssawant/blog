        "## Merge algorithms\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, we will focus on four methods currently implemented in mergekit. Note that there are other methods, such as linear and Task Arithmetic. If you’re interested in papers on model merging, I recommend this excellent collection on Hugging Face.\n",

        "### SLERP\n",
        "Spherical Linear Interpolation (SLERP) is a method used to smoothly interpolate between two vectors. It maintains a constant rate of change and preserves the geometric properties of the spherical space in which the vectors reside.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several reasons to prefer SLERP over a traditional linear interpolation. For example, in high-dimensional spaces, linear interpolation can lead to a decrease in the magnitude of the interpolated vector (i.e., it reduces the scale of weights). Moreover, the change in direction of the weights often represents more meaningful information (like feature learning and representation) than the magnitude of change.\n",
        "\n",
        "SLERP is implemented using the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Normalize the input vectors to unit length, ensuring they represent directions rather than magnitudes\n",
        "2. Calculate the angle between these vectors using their dot product.\n",
        "3. If the vectors are nearly collinear, it defaults to linear interpolation for efficiency. Otherwise, SLERP computing scale factors based on the interpolation factor t (t=0 = 100% of the first vector, t=1 = 100% of model 2) and the angle between the vectors.\n",
        "4. These factors are used to weigh the original vectors, which are then summed to obtain the interpolated vector.\n",
        "\n",
        "SLERP is currently the most popular merging method, but it is limited to combining only two models at a time.\n",

        "Introduced in this paper by Yadav et al., TIES-Merging is designed to efficiently merge multiple task-specific models into a single multitask model. It addresses two main challenges in model merging:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Redundancy in model parameters: It identifies and eliminates redundant parameters within task-specific models. This is achieved by focusing on the changes made during fine-tuning, identifying the top-k% most significant changes, and discarding the rest.\n",
        "* Disagreement between parameter signs: Conflicts arise when different models suggest opposing adjustments to the same parameter. TIES-Merging resolves these conflicts by creating a unified sign vector that represents the most dominant direction of change across all models.\n",
        "\n",
        "TIES-Merging is divided into the following three steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Trim: Reduces redundancy in task-specific models by retaining only a fraction the most significant parameters (density parameter) and resetting the rest to zero.\n",
        "2. Elect Sign: Resolves sign conflicts across different models by creating a unified sign vector based on the most dominant direction (positive or negative) in terms of cumulative magnitude.\n",
        "3. Disjoint Merge: Averages parameter values that align with the unified sign vector, excluding zero values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike SLERP, TIES can merge multiple models at a time.\n",

        "* Pruning: DARE randomly reset fine-tuned weights to their original values (those of the base model).\n",
