    "Visual language models (VLMs) have rapidly progressed, driven by the success of large language models (LLMs). However data curation of VLMs still remains under-explored. Given the costly nature of VLM training, most methods are confined with coarse-quality large-scale captioning image-text pairs (pretraining), followed by fine-grained small-scale supervised finetuning (SFT). Recent methods have observed rewarding distillation possibilities from GPT-4V and Gemini. However, the performance is upper bound by these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "So is it possible that the VLM itself can remedy dataset deficiency and enhance its training ?\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, researchers from Nvidia have introduced VILA-augmented VILA (VILA2), a novel approach that includes a self-augment step and a specialist-augment step to iteratively improve data quality and model performance. VILA2 consists of two main steps: a self-augment step and a specialist augment step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the self-augment step, a VLM recaptions its own pre-training data to enhance data quality, and then retrains from scratch using this refined dataset to improve model performance. This process can iterate for several rounds. Once self-augmentation saturates, VILA2 employs several specialist VLMs finetuned from the self-augmented VLM with domain-specific expertise, to further infuse specialist knowledge into the generalist VLM through task-oriented recaptioning and retraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, VILA2 re-formulate visual language model (VLM) training with a model in the loop to remedy training data defficacy. Then start with validating design options in constructing a self-augmenting loop to improve on caption quality of the default training task. After the saturation of this process, VLM is challenge to generate data conforming to extra SFT-enabled tasks to further VLM learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "VILA2 based foundational model consistently improves the accuracy on a wide range of tasks over prior art, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on MMMU leaderboard among open-sourced models.\n",
