    "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in stand-alone code tasks like HumanEval and MBPP, but struggle with handling entire code repositories. Current solutions rely on similarity-based retrieval or manual tools and APIs, each with notable drawbacks. Similarity-based retrieval often has low recall in complex tasks, while manual tools and APIs are typically task-specific and require expert knowledge, reducing their generalizability across diverse code tasks and real-world applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate these limitations, researcher have introduce CODEXGRAPH, a system that integrates LLM agents with graph database interfaces extracted from code repositories. By leveraging the structural properties of graph databases and the flexibility of the graph query language, CODEXGRAPH enables the LLM agent to construct and execute queries, allowing for precise, code structure-aware context retrieval and code navigation. \n",

    "CODEXGRAPH utilizes static analysis to extract code graphs from repositories using a task-agnostic schema that defines the nodes and edges within the code graphs. In these graphs, nodes represent source code symbols such as MODULE, CLASS, and FUNCTION, and each node is enriched with relevant meta-information. The edges between nodes represent the relationships among these symbols, such as CONTAINS, INHERITS, and USES. By leveraging the structural properties of graph databases, CODEXGRAPH enhances the LLM agentâ€™s comprehension of code structures. CODEXGRAPH leverages repository code information and graph structures for global analysis and multi-hop reasoning, enhancing code task performance. When users provide code-related inputs, the LLM agent analyzes the required information from the code graphs, constructs flexible queries using graph query language, and locates relevant nodes or edges. This enables precise and efficient retrieval, allowing for effective scaling to larger repository tasks.\n",

    "CODEXGRAPH was evaluated across three benchmarks: CrossCodeEval, SWE-bench, and EvoCodeBench. With a unified graph database schema, CODEXGRAPH demonstrates competitive performance and potential in both academic and real-world environments, showcasing its versatility and efficacy in software engineering.\n",
